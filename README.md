# Assignment 1 - Average Grade Calculator
## 200385752 - Nhat Mai (Nvi) - COMP1030 Programming Fundamentals
When you run the program, it will show the form of The Average Grade Calculator. You will need to press Add Course and program will generate automatically a row of course information that need to be inputed values.

Then you can press the Calculate button to have the average grade of all courses, the letter grade of each course and the final letter grade of all courses as well.

Please enjoy my program and let me know if there are any mistakes or confuses.

Thanks and have a good day,
